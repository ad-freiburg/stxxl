This directory contains some benchmarks referenced in past papers on
STXXL. These mostly compare to versions of TPIE, LEDA-SM and BerkeleyDB.

LEDA-SM test were removed as the library is no longer available.

TPIE and BerkeleyDB tests were removed as they required an old version
of TPIE (091905), which is no longer available.

All benchmarks not depending on external libraries are build with
-DSTXXL_BUILD_TESTS=ON.
